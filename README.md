# üè≠ How to install/use

This section describes how to run this app locally at your environment. For this you need to have `ruby 2.7.3`, `postgresql`, `node`, `git` installed.

- **Backend**

First of all, we need to setup some files, starting with `config/database.yml`, you'll need to define your user and password there, it's simple, there are two pairs of it, don't forget.

This part is optional, just if you want to see the mailer working, go to `config/enviroments/development.rb`, on the last lines you will need to set some configurations for `action_mailer` work, like email, password, domain...

If you don't have these gems, install it:
```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install rails
```

Open a shell and get the repository on your local files with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/m4ycon/petgato-7.git
$ cd petgato-7/backend
# install the gems
$ bundle install
$ rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
# start the server
$ rails s
```

- **Frontend**

You can replace `npm` by `yarn`, if you have it. Now open another shell and:

```bash
$ cd petgato-7/frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

And finally you can access the app on `http://localhost:3000`

Happy hacking!
